What's new in this release?

Added:
- Added recycle bin!
  - From now on, all deleted files will land there first
  - You can access the recycle bin in the new Recycle Bin tab
  - Recycle bin is inside My Summer Car folder in the new "Trash" folder
- If you have the newer version downloaded than the currenty available in server, the program won't try to downgrade itself
- Added ability to disable the message which appears when user is converting song over the limit of the current folder
- Added some more bugs to fix later ;)

Changes:
- Small UI changes
- Recycle bin buttons will now be disabled, if the bin is empty
- Move To window will now appear next to the cursor
- Language can now be changed without program having to restart
- Small changes in updating of song list
- Code optimization and improvements

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed not working "Changing Order: moved '{0}' to '{1}', and '{1}' to '{0}'" translation

Removed:
- Removed "remove source file" function. The program will now delete files that have been pasted into Radio or CD folder, and not when user converted song by drag & dropping file, preventing the infinite conversion loop
