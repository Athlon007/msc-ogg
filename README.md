## Localisation

MSCMM at this moment is fully localised in English and Polish languages. If you want to help with translation to Your language, here's what you want to do.

1. Download [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
2. Download the [template translation](TemplateTranslation.po)
3. Open Poedit and open the template translation
4. Go to Catalogue (or press Alt+Enter) -> and select Language to yours
5. Go to File -> Preferences and fill "Information about the translator" section

You're ready to start making your translation! After you're done, you can test your translation, by pasting it into "locales" folder in MSCMM folder and going into Settings -> Languages.

Once you're done, you can send the file either o [this mail](mail.jpg), or send it on Steam Community discussion.

| ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® | Suomi (FI)   | Daniel Pommell | 98%       | Due to the fact that this locale has been sent with 2.9.1 in mind, some lines have been machine translated not by the original translator! |

We're version this project with sequence-based identifiers versioning (2.0, then 2.1...).

## Building the source code

The program was build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community, so I think it's the best way to compile it.
