# My Summer Car OGG Converter
This tool initially was created for me to help convert all of my MP3 music into the OGG format. But I realised other people may use it, so there it is.

If you downloaded this program from the other sides than this GitLab repo or my website, I don't guarantee its safety. 
**YOU SHOULD ONLY DOWNLOAD IT FROM HERE!**
Also remember this tool is free - if you payed for it, you were scammed!

## Used third party libraries:
- NReco Video Converter for .NET
- FFMpeg
- .NET Framework 4.6

## Contribution
Anyone who will can contribute into this project (when I'll figure out this Git thing...). It seriously needs some work, y'kno?

## Versioning
We version this project by year, month, day and time (HHMMss). I personally use [Automatic Versions tool by Precision Infinity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PrecisionInfinity.AutomaticVersions), which does that automaticly.

## Building the source code
The program was build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community, so I think it's the best way to compile it.
