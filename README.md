# My Summer Car OGG Converter
This tool initially was created for me to help convert all of my MP3 music into the OGG format. But I realised other people may use it, so there it is.

If you downloaded this program from the other sides than this GitLab repo or my website, I don't guarantee its safety. 
**YOU SHOULD ONLY DOWNLOAD IT FROM HERE!**
